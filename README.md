## Features

- A classic tic tac toe game implemented using pure HTML/CSS/JS
- Name entry using a smooth invisible modal

<br>

## Outcome

- Used CSS3 **grid** and **flex** to manage layout
- Used IIFEs to create separate modules

<br>

## What I learned

- Use of **Javascript** IIFEs to modularise code
- Using multiple layers of modal to force a progression through inputs

<br>

## Reflections

This was a fun project to work on. I experimented with using 2 modals on page load that disappear after inputting data and pressing enter. (I always wondered how they achieved this effect on more modern user-friendly websites.)

One bug that I encountered was not noticing that I'd used "" in some places and " " in others. This caused a lot of weird behaviour, but is now fixed. Don't use spaces in quotes, folks!
