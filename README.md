# Odin Tic Tac Toe

This was a fun project to work on. I experimented with using 2 modals on page load that disappear after inputting data and pressing enter. (I always wondered how they achieved this effect on more modern user-friendly websites.)

One bug that I encountered was not noticing that I'd used "" in some places and " " in others. This caused a lot of weird behaviour, but is now fixed. Don't use spaces in quotes, folks!
